        <p>My name is Cameron Massengill. When creating this project, I was a senior undergraduate majoring in Computer Engineering at the college of Mississippi State University. This Dissection website was designed for the ECE 4723 - Embedded Systems course in the Spring of 2022. This dissection project consisted of reverse engineering of a consumer electronic device with the intention of understanding the devices design choices and operation.
          </p>
          <p>
          This website features reverse engineering of the <strong>Faceuer MP3 Player, Portable Mini Music Player Back-Clip LCD Screen MP3 Music Player for Walking Running, with Earphone(Black)</strong>. The objective is to allow the reader to fully understand the operation of the MP3 Player and, if the reader really wants to, re-create the same device.

          <h2>MP3 History</h2>
        <p>Early 1970s: Prof. Dieter Seitzer of Erlangen-Nuremberg University in Germany begins wrestling with the problem of transmitting speech in high quality over phone lines. Although a first patent application was rejected, he establishes a group of students interested in audio coding research who start tackling the problem for their diploma and Ph.D. theses.</p>
        <p>Late 1970s: With the introduction of ISDN and fiber optic cables for telecommunication, improved speech coding seems to become less important. As a new idea, the team of Prof. Seitzer starts research in coding of music signals.</p>
        <p>1979: Prof. Seitzer's team develops the first digital signal processor capable of audio compression. During subsequent development, Karlheinz Brandenburg, a student in that team, starts employing psychoacoustic principles in the audio coding schemes, feeding back important findings and corrections into the science of the hearing properties of the human ear. Guided by Prof. Seitzer, Brandenburg and the team achieve continuous improvement of their coding algorithms.</p>
        <p>1981: The Compact Disc is presented to the public. For storing audio data, it uses uncompressed linear PCM with 16 bit/sample.</p>
        <p>1987-1989: A research alliance is formed between Erlangen-Nuremberg University and the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits within the framework of the European Union funded EUREKA project EU147 for Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB). Led by Prof. Heinz Gerhäuser (Fraunhofer IIS), the joint research team puts up a functional real-time codec of the LC-ATC (Low Complexity Adaptive Transform Coding) algorithm as the basis for its research. Up to that point, LC-ATC existed only as a simulation on computer. Due to the enormous computing time required it could be tested only with a very limited amount of audio material. The real-time codec enables testing LC-ATC under real-world conditions and leads to significant algorithmic optimizations. The hardware system comprising multiple Digital Signal Processor (DSP) modules and a number of audio and data I/O interface cards is developed by a group of scientists including Harald Popp and Ernst Eberlein.</p>
        <p>1991: Presentation of ASPEC 19” studio equipment for reliable transmission of speech and music between broadcasting studios via ISDN (from left: Jürgen Herre, Martin Dietz, Harald Popp, Ernst Eberlein, Karlheinz Brandenburg, Heinz Gerhäuser).</p>
        <p>A new high-performance audio codec called ASPEC (Adaptive Spectral Perceptual Entropy Coding) is presented as the result of further improvements of OCF and contributions by Hannover University, AT&T, and Thomson. The development partners had proposed ASPEC already in 1989 for the forthcoming MPEG audio standard.</p>
        <p>MPEG in total received 14 proposals for audio coding. Encouraged by MPEG, the audio coding contributions are merged into four proposals including ASPEC and MUSICAM. After several formal tests, MPEG suggests erecting a family of three audio coding schemes from MUSICAM and ASPEC: Layer 1 is a low complexity variant of MUSICAM, Layer 2 an optimized version of MUSICAM and Layer 3 is based on ASPEC.</p>
        <p>Due to its lower complexity, Layer 2 is selected by DAB as the audio format for digital audio broadcasting services whereas the ASPEC / Layer 3 coder with its highest coding efficiency known at that time (and higher complexity) becomes the key to transmitting high quality audio via ISDN phone lines. As a proof of concept, Fraunhofer IIS manufactures and sells a number of ASPEC 19” studio racks to professional users such as radio stations. In this way, transmitting speech and music reliably via ISDN between broadcasting studios becomes the first real application of the Fraunhofer IIS audio coding algorithms. The evolution from ASPEC to the final "mp3" (MPEG-1, Layer 3) codec involves some technological harmonization with the other planned MPEG-1 audio coders and the addition of a joint stereo coding mode, the latter developed by Jürgen Herre. In December, the technical development of the MPEG-1 standard is finished. Layer 3 offers near CD quality at less than 2 bits/sample. [1]</p>

        <p>While this table is not a complete list of all the possible MP3 Players, it includes the top rated MP3 players that have the same functionality and price range as the dissected device.</p>
        <p>The Faceuer MP3 Player, Portable Mini Music Player Back-Clip LCD Screen MP3 Music Player for Walking Running, with Earphone appears to be a good competitor in the basic LCD screen MP3 Player market due to its cost and size. Out of the products on this list, the dissected device offers one of the smallest dimensions and offers the cheapest price for the most basic operations.</p>

            <p>This particular MP3 Player contains a variety of input/output devices to provide the user with a convenient experience:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Input:</li><br>
                <ul>
                  <li>5x SPST Switches</li><br>
                  <li>1x SD Card slot</li><br>
                  <li>1x Micro-USB port</li><br>
                </ul>
              <li>Output:</li><br>
                <ul>
                  <li>1x Jack</li><br>
                  <li>1x LCD Screen</li>
                </ul>
            </ul><br>
